# Test project

The goal is to have a working basic app that use helix, the mantine components library and portfolio.

## Disclaimer
This is an experiment for now, the production build config doesn't exists. Use at your own peril.

## To start development
* First get the npm deps `npm install`
* In one terminal `bb run shadow:dev` start a shadow cljs watch
* In another terminal `bb run rollup:dev` to start the js bundler

Open the [local app](http://localhost:1420/) to get to the app.
Open the [local portfolio](http://localhost:1421/) to get to portfolio.
